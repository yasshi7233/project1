# Smart Product Pricing – Approach Overview

Team & Roles 
- Member 1:Data, Infrastructure, Flask deployment  
- Member 2: Machine Learning & Feature Engineering  
- Member 3: Image Processing & Embeddings  


Problem Framing
- Objective: Predict product prices using textual and image data.  
- Metric: SMAPE  
- Constraints: No external data; only provided dataset  



Data
- Columns Used: `sample_id`, `catalog_content` (title/description/IPQ), `image_link`  
- Preprocessing: Missing value handling, log transformation of `price` to handle outliers  



Feature Engineering
Text Features: 
- Cleaned text, split title/description  
- Extracted Item Pack Quantity (IPQ)  
- TF-IDF (1–2 grams)  
- Text length and keyword flags  

Image Features (Member 3): 
- Downloaded images with retries  
- Resized and normalized images (224×224)  
- Extracted embeddings using pretrained CNNs (ResNet50/EfficientNet)  
- Aligned embeddings with `sample_id` for merging with text/numeric features  


 Modeling
- Baselines: Linear Regression, Random Forest  
- Boosting: LightGBM, XGBoost  
- Target: log(price); inverse transform during inference  
- Ensemble: Averaging predictions from multiple models  


Validation & Evaluation
- Train/validation split  
- SMAPE monitored; robustness to outliers  
- Public leaderboard comparison

Inference Pipeline
1. Merge text + image features  
2. Predict log(price) for all test `sample_id`  
3. Inverse transform to get final price predictions  
4. Ensure predicted price > 0  



Tools & Libraries
- `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `LightGBM`, `XGBoost`  
- `torch`, `torchvision`, `keras` for image embeddings  
- Flask for optional deployment  



 Compliance & Limitations
- No external data or price scraping  
- Limitations: quantity/brand parsing, ensemble tuning, robust image download
